## [Career Aspiration]{style="color: #FFA500;"}

I aspire to build a global career in sports marketing, where I can bridge the gap between international audiences and major sports properties. With over a decade of experience in sports media rights, brand partnerships, and business development in China, I bring a unique perspective to the evolving digital marketing landscape. My goal is to contribute to sports organizations by creating impactful, data-driven marketing strategies that enhance fan engagement, drive sponsorship value, and expand global reach—especially as I complete my Master’s in Digital Marketing at Cal Poly Pomona.
